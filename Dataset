Dataset Description

For the cataract grading dataset, The IIITD Cataract Mobile Periocular (CMP) database was utilized as the cataractous and normal data images in the current project 
which was MSc thesis at the University of Waterloo. 
This database contained images capturing ocular information utilizing the photo-capturing functionality of the smartphones in the visible spectrum. 
For more information about the IIITD dataset you can refer to the paper.

Since due to my contract with the IIITD dataset owners, I am not allowed to share the whole dataset without the owners permission, I am just sharing three samples of the images. If it is required I can ask for the permission.
